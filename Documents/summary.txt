In this paper, we developed a system that can be used to build a virtual Hong Kong in the virtual world. To ensure that the system is precise, coordinates were to be determined first, and due to the size of the area, we chose the Hong Kong 1980 coordinates, which is also used to draw civilian maps in Hong Kong. The height is determined by the Standard Sea Level. Thus, the position of an element can be determined in Hong Kong.

After that, we developed the basic elements of the system. Similar to the game Minecraft, elements are divided into two parts: shapes and entities. Shapes are used to determine objects that do not move a lot, like buildings and terrain, and entities for the rest, for example, transportation and animals. We developed some properties to describe them. There are certain relationships between them, and some of these are considered as properties as well.

To determine the calculation need for a ‘refresh’, we first need to determine what is a ‘fit’ for a certain set of elements. Q-Learning algorithm and K-means algorithm are perfect for these conditions. Hence, the calculation of the system is easy to be determined.

We divided a ‘refresh’ into two parts, ‘shapes’ refresh, which is to be done under the instruction of humans, and ‘entity’ refresh, which are done automatically. The pixels and distance between the observer and the object, and the movement of the object are considered, and some indexes describing lag and clearance are defined. Therefore, the calculation amount can be simplified into a simple equation, and data were obtained via the Internet and Sattelite Images. Finally, we get the results to the questions proposed in the problem.
